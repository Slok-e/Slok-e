## Brief history

My name is Kelso, I started getting serious about trying to do Computer Science/ IT May this year (2022)
I started with a small goal of just see what im interested in and try and learn from there. I downloaded a couple
of coding education apps like; Mimo, SoloLearn, and watched 100's of Youtube videos. I'm currently a student at Arizona Stat University(Online) which I began pursuing a Bachelors in Information Technology, as of the beggining of this year(2022). This is after about 4 or 5 years of not continuing college, having my first child made me want to get a career,
and some security to I can properly support him.

## Goals

1. My overall goals are to be language fluent for the most part, I'm sure I'll choose something to specialize in, but for now I'm open to learning everything.

2. I also want to get a job in tech be it:
    
    -Data Analysis
    
    -Software Development
    
    -AI    
    
    -Robotics
    
    -Networking
 
 I'm interested in a lot of stuff.
